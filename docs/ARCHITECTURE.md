## Overview


## Requirements

### TLD management: 

- This allows us to create a registry that manages the TLD, such that we can accept requests from registrars (user-facing businesses that let people look up available domain names and buy domains)
    - The requests from registrars are sent via [EPP commands](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3731). Nomulus has built-in tools to parse and process these commands.
- We will need to add web3 capabilities to the registry managed by Nomulus, so it reads and writes the blockchain when it is processing EPP requests (and other types of requests) from registrars.
- Since existing registrars are not taking the necessary web3 information from users (which at minimum, should include wallet address and a signature to authorize a request), we will also need to build a simple registrar to demonstrate how it should be done.
    - In the non-custodial case, the registrar can be a UI-only client. This should be what we build first
    - If the registrar wants to operates in a conventional way and takes the custody of the domains for users without web3 wallets, it will also need a server. We should build a simple example of that as well, so we can partner with traditional registrars


## Components

### ENS Fronted

Lets users register their domains. Currently Harmony has developed a demonstration application deployed at https://ens.demo.harmony.one/ using the codebase https://github.com/polymorpher/.1.country/tree/main/client. This has limited functionality where a site can be rented for 3 months, with the ability for others to surpass the rental by paying double the last rental amount. Initial rental amount is 100 ONE. This does not support Top Level Domains (TLDs) instead Tier 2 domains under `.1.country` are suppored e.g. `alice.1.country`.

*An indepth review of the exisisting ENS Application can be found in [1NS-Design](./1NS-DESIGN.md).*

### ENS Web3 Backend

Provides the smart contract functionality for registering and renting domains. Currently Harmony has developed a single smart contract [D1DC.sol](https://github.com/polymorpher/.1.country/blob/main/contracts/contracts/D1DC.sol). To provide this functionality.

*An indepth review of the exisisting ENS Smart Contracts can be found in [1NS-Design](./1NS-DESIGN.md).*


### Web 2 Registry

This provides functionality for registering web 2 domains. Capturing the domain owner, contact details and period of ownership. It does not manage the Domains DNS entries which is the responsiblity of the Domain Name Server. Currently Harmony uses [UNI NAMING AND REGISTRY](https://uniregistry.link/) (UNR). There has also been an initial Review of Open Source Code Registry [Nomulus by Google](https://github.com/google/nomulus) which can be found in [Review -> Registry](#registry).

### Web 2 Domain Name Server

This provides the managment of DNS entries, contact information and other technical and administrative information for a domain. Below in [Reviews -> Name Servers](#name-servers) are high level criteria for the functionality required to support web3 as well as open source code bases under evaluation.

### Name Servers - Criteria and CodeBases for Review

#### Criteria

- Built-in authentication systems - we need to transform this to web3 authentication
- Gated APIs for updating records
- Support common DNS record types (A, CNAME, MX, TXT)
- Ideally in modern languages (Golang, Rust, C++17 or later, Python, Node.js, Scala)
- We could consider just implementing a full web3 version and store all records on smart contracts (extending ENS contracts or building our own), if this can be done in 1-2 weeks

#### Summary
A list of potential code bases for DNS Name Servers was collected and a deep dive of the top 6 eligble code bases was conducted. Inital thoughts are that [core-dns](#core-dns-go---ranking-1) is the most eligible based on it's strong adoption, the fact that it's built in go which has good support for the web3 backend and that it has a plugin architecture with a reference plugin for ENS which can be used for inspiration. [trust-dns](#trust-dns-rust---ranking-2) is currently ranked second as it is not as widely adopted, it is written in rust which has proven web3 backend integration, it can be deployed as a standalone instance or customized crates can be developed which can be leveraged by the 1600 repositories which use the trust-dns-server crate today and there exists some ENS rust integrations, though they are minimal and minimally maintained. [nsd](#nsd-c---ranking-3) was placed lower on the list as it is built in C and web3 backend integration is uncertain, also it has a BSD license which is a little stricter than the GNU, MIT and Apache Licensing. That being said it is a mature and well adopted server with extensive documentation and support and the ability to engage NnetLabs professional services to speed up development time. 

The other repositories are included for completeness but currently though unviable to be used as a baseline. [gdnsd](#gdnsd-c---ranking-4) is not actively maintained and is more for querying than complete name server management. [node-dns](#node-dns-javascript---ranking-4) provides some good tools for javascript projects to interact with dns servers and could be leveraged in other applications or development but does not update domain name server functionality. [solana-dns](#solana-dns-javascript---ranking-5) was included for it's relevance for web3 backends however the project was more at the concept stage and never fully developed.

#### core-dns (go) - Ranking 1

**Summary**
[core-dns](https://github.com/coredns/coredns) is a popular repository with over 10,000 stars and 1800 forks. It has a comprehensive Plugin Approach.<sup>[1](#cd1)</sup><sup>[2](#cd2)</sup> which enables the chaining of plugins to customize logic when responding to a client request to `ServeDNS()`. "Core" Plugins have been developed by CoreDNS<sup>[3](#cd3)</sup> and also a number of specialized Plugins have been developed by third party developers<sup>[4](#cd4)</sup>

Of particular relevance is the ENS Plugin<sup>[5](#cd5)</sup> which enables nameservers to retrieve information from the Ethereum Blockchain seamlessly with the existing infrastructure. This uses go-ens<sup>[6](#cd6)</sup> to interact with the ens-contracts.<sup>[7](#cd7)</sup> All repositories appear to be actively maintained with recent commits.

Development Approach: Develop a harmony specific plugin for coredns leveraging the existing codebase.

**Evaluation Criteria**
1. Authentication: Is currently supported by the acl-plugin<sup>[7](#cd7)</sup> which can optionally be enabled to `users are able to block or filter suspicious DNS queries by configuring IP filter rule sets, i.e. allowing authorized queries or blocking unauthorized queries.` A similar plugin could be written to enable authentication via web3.
2. APIs
3. DNS Record Type Support
4. Modern Language: Yes
5. Development TimeFrame: Although the coreDns framework is large the architecture allowing building of a specific plugin as well as the reference ENS plugin and codebase should reduce development time.



**References**

<a name="cd1">[1]</a>  [CoreDNS Plugin Approach](https://coredns.io/2017/03/01/how-to-add-plugins-to-coredns/): CoreDNS is a DNS server that chains plugins. A plugin is defined as a method: ServeDNS() that gets a request and either responds to the client or passes it on to the next plugin. If none of the plugins handle the request a default response of SERVFAIL is returned.

<a name="cd2">[2]</a>  [CoreDNS Enabling Plugins](https://coredns.io/2017/07/25/compile-time-enabling-or-disabling-plugins/): CoreDNS' plugins (or external plugins) can be enabled or disabled on the fly by specifying (or not specifying) it in the Corefile. But you can also compile CoreDNS with only the plugins you need and leave the rest completely out.

<a name="cd3">[3]</a>  [CoreDNS Developed Plugins ](https://coredns.io/plugins/): Provides a list of all Plugins developed by CoreDNS. source code can be found on [github](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/tree/master/plugin).

<a name="cd5">[5]</a>  [ENS Plugin](https://coredns.io/explugins/ens/): The ens plugin serves DNS records from the Ethereum Name Service. Source code can be found on [github](https://github.com/wealdtech/coredns-ens). With a detailed description found in [EthDNS: an Ethereum backend for the Domain Name System](http://www.wealdtech.com/articles/ethdns-an-ethereum-backend-for-the-domain-name-system/)

> The nameservers for the my.xyz domain have been configured to fetch information not from a local store but from the Ethereum blockchain, shown as the Ethereum symbol in the bottom-right corner of the diagram. Note that the name resolution process is exactly the same as in the previous diagram, and that the client is unaware that the information has been returned from the blockchain. This makes EthDNS a drop-in replacement for existing nameservers, working seamlessly with the existing infrastructure.

> As much as I would love to have an EPP client written in go, it isn't likely that an EPP client would be useful to many users. Only registrars typically have access to the EPP endpoints at registries. And even then, it is likely that they don't allow individual services to connect directly to the EPP endpoints since the registries impose connection count limits.

#### trust-dns (rust) - Ranking 2

Summary: [trust-dns](https://github.com/bluejekyll/trust-dns): is a widely used project with 2,600 stars, 313 forks and 1077 users of the project. It is built using rust and has a modular framwork producing 8 rust crates<sup>[1](#td1)</sup> which can be used by other rust applications (similar to npm packages for javascript) as well as being able to be deployed as a standalone DNS authoritative server. It's Goals<sup>[2](#td2)</sup> focus on safety, security and simplicity. It has widespread support for Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comments (RFC's)<sup>[3](#td3)</sup>. 

Development Approach: Deploy Standalone Version and modify the [server crate](https://github.com/bluejekyll/trust-dns/tree/main/crates/server)<sup>[1](#td1)</sup>,  to use Harmony Blockchain instead of sql-lite for [store](https://github.com/bluejekyll/trust-dns/tree/main/crates/server/src/store) functionality. Note: there are minimal ENS rust codebases<sup>[4](#td4)</sup><sup>[5](#td5)</sup><sup>[6](#td6)</sup>. Which can be reviewed for devleopment of the rust to Harmony ENS backend. Optionally a harmony-specific server crate can be published with could be used by the 1684 projects currently using trust-dns-server<sup>[7](#td7)</sup>.

**Evaluation Criteria**
1. Authentication: 
2. APIs: 
3. DNS Record Type Support: Good
4. Modern Language: Yes Rust
5. Development TimeFrame: The development approach is fairly clear. Factors to consider is the availibility of Rust developers and the fact that there are minimal ens references to leverage.

> [The Project] Just stopped, it was a fun side project proposal to our friends on the solana team for a potential use case for the platform. They ended up giving us other solana work instead but thought dns was a cool idea, never got funding to do the DNS thing though. Feel free to rip off all/some/any of it, it's up for grabs if you want to build something similar! 🙂

It also contains a [Data Flow](https://github.com/Monadical-SAS/solana-dns#data-flow) and [Execution Flow](https://github.com/Monadical-SAS/solana-dns#execution-flow).

> **So what does Solana add to the equation?**
>                    
>    It removes the root DNS servers from the trust equation (e.g. the `.com` TLD servers). Remember that they have ultimate control over all record authentication because they could choose to ignore or maliciously change the DNSSEC public key that you published via the registrar. This implicit trust can be removed in Solana DNS because the public key is the user's wallet public key, which is intrinsically tied to their identity on the platform. Solana has no power to change the public key because the chain forms an immutable record, and only later statements signed with a revocation key are recognized by clients as authorized to change the public key in control of a given domain.
>                    
>    This isn't just a case of "slap a blockchain on it and hope it gets better", this is a true novel distributed database-style solution that hasn't been feasible with traditional blockchains. Running usable DNS on blockchains is now feasible with the advent of fast proof-of-history chains, because it enables updates to happen within DNS TTL windows like 30sec, which are well below the 10min verification time that a chain like Bitcoin would require. Because changes can also be synchronously applied to appear to everyone across the world at the same time, we can also lose the "eventual consistency" and propagation delay issues that plagued standard DNS systems in the past.
>                     
>    Solana DNS can also retain the nice distributed properties of past DNS systems. Because all records are signed all the way up to the root using the domain owner's public key, any node can serve up records without users having to implicitly trust them. The query results will always arrive signed with a key that can be verified to ensure malicous middle-boxes cant get away with modifying records.
>                    
> **Potential problems?**
>                    
>    - Solana may be fast, but the RPC communication with the Solana chain may be significantly slower than DNS over UDP
>    - If RPC communication becomes the bottleneck, we end up having to implement time-synchronized caching servers with fairly complex validation/staking mechanics to penalize clock drift and inadherence to signed record TTL expiry times. This problem becomes slightly simpler if we only allow caching on localhost, with no middleboxes between the local Solana DNS server and the Solana chain API.
>    - It may not be necessary to replace DNSSEC entirely, it's possible to just sign the same root public key used on the TLD in Solana, and use DNSSEC from there on down the chain (checking against the Solana root key instead of the implicitly trusted root-server-published key)
>    - The mechanics around domain ownership verification need to be figured out (or whether it's even necessary with Solana DNS)
>    - The mechanics of pinning identities to keys needs to be figured out (whether via staking, 3rd party identity providers, or something else)
>    - The mechanics of key issuing, rotating, and revocation need to be figured out (proper revocation is haaard, we dont want domains being lost forever to the ether because someone lost a private key)
>                    
> Given the power of an immutable, globally sychronized database, with key-based identity baked in, many of the distributed-systems and authentication problems that have plagued DNS in the past become drastically easier to solve. Unfortunately, designing DNS system to seamlessly augment or entirely replace existing DNS authentication mechanisms is incredibly complex. Though our ambitions are big, this project will likely have to make some decisions early on to narrow the scope and pick a few core features to focus on as a proof-of-concept.
